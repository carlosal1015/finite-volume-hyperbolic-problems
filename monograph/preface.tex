\preface

A preface\index{preface} is a book's preliminary statement, usually written by the \textit{author or editor} of a work, which states its origin, scope, purpose, plan, and intended audience, and which sometimes includes afterthoughts and acknowledgments of assistance.

When written by a person other than the author, it is called a foreword.
The preface or foreword is distinct from the introduction, which deals with the subject of the work.

Customarily \textit{acknowledgments} are included as last part of the preface.
