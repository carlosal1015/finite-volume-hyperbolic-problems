\section{Scientific Justification}

Due to problems that arise in the fields of
agriculture~\cite{Richards1931,Tan2018} and oil
extraction~\cite{Cajuhi2019}, the
Buckley-Leverett~\cite{Buckley1942} and Koval~\cite{Koval1963} models
could be used to model these, which allow us to gain a qualitative
understanding of the behavior of two-phase fluids.
Therefore, we analyze the existence and uniqueness of initial
value or boundary problems
that arise in the field of partial differential equations.
Subsequently, using appropriate numerical analysis tools, we will perform simulations
and compare them with articles that present experimental results.
